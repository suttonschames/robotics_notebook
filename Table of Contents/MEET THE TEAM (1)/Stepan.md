Stepan Sarkisov - Class of 2026
## Who are you, and what do you do?
Hiya, my name is Stepan Sarkisov, I am a senior, the driver, lead programmer and, co-builder of our team. 
### How did we get here?
My start in VEX Robotics was in 2024 when Over-Under was coming to a close, but my first true VEX game was High-Stakes. During the 2024-2025 I competed in a total of 3 competitions with my robot which I built as a solo builder, programmer, and driver. I had quite a successful season making it as far as semifinals in one of my tournaments. I even qualified for states, which I sadly couldn't go to for various reasons. My last couple of months after High-Stakes ended were spent in development of a new software framework to excel in the autonomous phase. And I could not be more exited to show off my hard work on the field. 

### What I contribute to the team
I am, first and foremost, a software developer. I have also proved to not be too shabby at building. In addition I have taken initiative to do everyone's least favorite chore: CAD-ing the robot. And I personally created the autonomous selector which you can see in the following sections. I have also done countless of hours of research into [[Odometry]] and how to use it.
