## SEPTEMBER 1ST - SEPTEMBER 5TH

Stepan and I were very happy to be back in the robotics room! It's one thing to work on the robot at home, but it's an entirely different thing to work on it where you have access to your usual tools. Now that we had access to the lab again, Stepan was able to move our indexer from the base of the robot's intake mechanism, to the top. This solved our issue with inconsistent intaking.

Unfortunately, Stepan wasn't able to fit robotics class into his schedule this year, so most of his work was done during office hours and lunch. On the other side, I was able to become a Robotics Class TA, so I'm in the classroom quite frequently. This somewhat balances out the timing issue, so long as we communicate enough. Between Stepan's work sessions, I was able to entirely rework our wiring so all wires were an optimal length, well organized, and no longer snagging on various mechanisms.
