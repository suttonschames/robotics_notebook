## SEPTEMBER 8TH - SEPTEMBER 12TH

This week, Stepan and I decided on a poly carbonate hood for the upper output. We were hesitant on using poly carb for a while, given this season's restrictions on poly carb usage. Testing with other materials (as the shown in the table below) confirmed that the most familiar was going to be our best option, at least for the time being. 

In the latter half of the week, I also worked on adding more standoffs for stability. My driving is a bit aggressive (sorry Stepan...), so the added bracing proved very helpful. While doing this overhaul, I also noticed that our cortex was in a suboptimal position (on the right side of the robot, facing outwards). Once Stepan and I finished up the new standoffs, I changed our cortex location and tucked it in the back of the robot, under the collection basket. At the moment this location is great, and our cortex has yet to suffer any more direct hits to field elements.
