## SEPTEMBER 29TH - OCTOBER 3RD


This week started off with some frustration — during testing, one of our front wheels cracked after a rough landing off the field barrier. Upon inspection, we also found that one of the 84-tooth gears in the intake assembly had chipped teeth, likely from over-tightening the bearing mounts.

I replaced both the broken wheel and gear, and while we had the front assembly open, Stepan worked on rerouting the pneumatics tubing to make the layout more compact. We also rethreaded the intake string for smoother motion and made sure there was enough tension to grab triballs consistently without overloading the motor.

After reassembling everything, we ran several intake tests — it’s now performing better than before, with fewer jams and faster cycling.
