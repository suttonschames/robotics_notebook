#RBbuilding
## NOVEMBER 3RD - NOVEMBER 7TH

With mechanical systems stabilizing and early-season prototypes completed, this week was lighter on competitive development but meaningful for team identity and workflow. I proposed painting the robot to match our team aesthetic.

When I asked Stepan for a color choice, he immediately suggested bright pink. After confirming the idea, Sutton contacted her dad and asked him to mix the paint from the family store

Stepan came over to my house and the two of us spent the afternoon applying the color across the chassis and upper assemblies. The paint fumes were strong (like. headache inducing.), but the final result gave our robot a distinctive, high-visibility look on the field. While this week did not emphasize mechanical or programming progress, the paint job increased visibility for drivers and certainly contributed to team morale.

**Reflection / Next Steps:**

- The color helps with field visibility, especially when tracking robot orientation quickly during driver practice.

- No major mechanical or software progress this week; next week we return to functional upgrades and autonomous consistency work.
