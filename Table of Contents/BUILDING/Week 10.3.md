## OCTOBER 20TH - OCTOBER 24TH

This week’s main focus was stabilizing the robot’s base and addressing a bent coupler that I  damaged during stress testing. While testing the intake and output under full load, the robot started to wobble and drive weirdly. The frame also looked odd, but it took Stepan's inspection for us to figure out why. Stepan found that one of the standoff couplers connecting the drivetrain had warped — likely from repeated torque strain (aka: me smashing the robot into walls... oopsie!)

I removed the damaged coupler and replaced it with a new one, adding an extra two for stability. To further stabilize the chassis, I added a thin crossbar across the midsection, which significantly reduced frame flex.

Once everything was reassembled, I ran several full-speed movement tests. The robot now drives much more smoothly, and the slight drift we noticed earlier is completely gone. Next week, we plan to resume driver practice and start testing the intake again under competitive conditions.
