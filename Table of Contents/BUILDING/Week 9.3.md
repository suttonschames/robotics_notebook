## SEPTEMBER 15TH - SEPTEMBER 19TH

Due to my aforementioned aggressive driving style, Stepan added some poly carb barriers Infront of critical points of the robot. We currently have these barriers Infront of the cortex, and the intake mechanism, since I was consistently popping the chain on impact. We were both a bit busy this week and weren't able to make as many adjustments as we had hoped.
