## SEPTEMBER 22ND - SEPTEMBER 26TH

This week’s main focus was improving drivetrain consistency. During our first few driver practice runs, we noticed that one side of the robot was pulling slightly to the right, which threw off our ability to align with the match load bar. After checking the wheels, we realized one of the gears on the right side was slightly stripped, causing uneven torque distribution.

We removed the old gear, replaced it with a reinforced 36-tooth gear, and applied Loctite to prevent future slippage. While the chassis was open, I also took the chance to secure motor cables using zip ties and Velcro mounts, so they’re no longer rubbing against the aluminum frame.

By the end of the week, the robot was driving straighter and responding more smoothly to joystick input. Our next step will be to start fine-tuning the pneumatics and ensure all tubing is airtight before we add pressure to the system.
