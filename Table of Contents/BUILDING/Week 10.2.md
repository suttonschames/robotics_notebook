## OCTOBER 13TH - OCTOBER 17TH

We picked up right where we left off before the break. This week was mostly about pneumatics and the start of our autonomous code. I finished securing all the air tubing and mounted the air tanks in a position that keeps the center of gravity low. Stepan and Mr. Lichten helped test for leaks by pressurizing the system to 100 PSI and using soapy water; no bubbles appeared, which means our fittings are airtight!

On the programming side, I started developing the base structure for our autonomous routine. We’re using odometry to track the robot’s position, and I began testing a short path that drives forward to collect the first ball. So far, the timing needs refinement, but it’s exciting to see the bot moving on its own.

Next week’s goal: tune the pneumatic firing timing and adjust our auton speed curves for smoother transitions.
