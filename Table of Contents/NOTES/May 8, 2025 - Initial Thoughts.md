#RBnotes 
Stepan and Sutton were both watching the final 2-3 hours of the VEX Worlds livestream and chatting throughout, but that's not why you're reading this notebook! Immediately after the game reveal, we called for a few hours and began discussing our opinions, ideas, and concerns about Push Back and our next robot.

To reduce the length of this document, Sutton split the actual planning into multiple files, which have been linked below. We recommend you read about our first opinions, concerns, and questions before looking at the beginning of our ideation process.

- **[[Initial Build Ideas]]**
	- [[Initial Intake]]
	- [[Initial Drivetrain]]
	- [[Initial Scoring Mech]]
	- [[Initial De-Scoring Mech]]
- **[[Initial Concerns]]**
- **[[Initial Questions]]**
### Opinions
- Similar playstyle to to OverUnder
- Emphasis on mobility and driver coordination
- Tug of war, control bonuses, and parking are interesting game elements, very reminiscent of Tipping Point, Sack Attack, and a bit of Bridge Battle
- Match loading mechanic is great! During Over Under, we faced some rule violations for having our hands in the field, there were lots of similarly specific rules about match loading that honestly took away from the game. The dropper mechanic should be able to prevent the issue of "unfair loading" violations, and help this game involve non-driver players.
### Concerns
- The ball dropper has a lip at the bottom, so removing objects won't be as straight forward.
- Parking zones -> what is considered "in"?
### Questions
- The game devs mentioned **new expansion rules**, which makes sense given the height of the main scoring tube. Will vertical expansion be unlimited?
- How much will the scoring objects weigh?
	- **Plastic or foam**?
- Will there be a **time-based restriction** on de-scoring?
	- In High Stakes, mobile goals couldn't be taken out of corners in the final 30 seconds. We're wondering if a similar restriction will occur in this game.
