#### De-scoring Mechanism
- **Piston Arm**
	- We could probably use a pneumatic piston mechanism to push a few q-bits out of the tube!
- **Mad Gorilla**
	- During the live demo, one of the devs bumped into a scoring tube and a few q-bits fell out. While this could've been a fluke, it looks like **shaking the tubes** should be a pretty effective method for de-scoring
	- Using linear motion to build an arm, we could **latch onto the top of the tube** and simply drive back and forth aggressively.
- **Battering Ram**
	- Linear motion could be used to push a long object forward and nearly clear the scoring tube!
- ##### **Reversible Intake**
	- Reversible intake could serve for collection and de-scoring mechanisms, easy to integrate with intake
