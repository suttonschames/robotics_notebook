#RBnotes [[May 8, 2025 - Initial Thoughts]]
- Intake should have adjustable height
	- **Vertically adjustable intake** (maybe sliding rail system, or 2-bar lift?) could allow us to collect q-bits from different field positions to score and de-score them quickly
	- Could absolutely be paired with a flywheel or rubber band roller
- Side Rollers
	- Rollers on the sides of the intake can help **funnel misaligned q-bits** to the center of the robot
	- May help with **orientation and alignment** of score mechanism too
- Anti-tip frame in drivetrain
	- Since we'll be driving more aggressively, a **lower center of gravity and wider wheelbase** can help distribute impacts evenly and prevent tipping when any vertical elements are extended
- Ratchet Parking Brake
	- A **ratchet lock mechanism** could hold the robot in place during the endgame parking phase, especially if other bots are **pushing**. This could also be helpful if we wanted to stop another team from de-scoring, or stay still while we score.
