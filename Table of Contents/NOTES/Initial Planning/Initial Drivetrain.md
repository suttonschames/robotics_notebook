#### Drivetrain
- **Speed** and **maneuverability** will be very important for this game, and due to the game not really focusing on climbing, we could absolutely afford a 6 motor drivetrain
	- "Just because you can afford something, doesn't make it a good idea" - *Stepan, 2025*
- A 6 motor blue drivetrain wouldn't be a great idea due to overheating, we could absolutely **gear 4 green motors** and achieve a better speed.
	- *36T* & *72T* should work
- While somewhat unstable, **screw joints** will help with motor burnout and speed
