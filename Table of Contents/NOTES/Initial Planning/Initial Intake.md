#### Intake
- **Flywheel**
	- Sutton desperately wants a flywheel **somewhere** in this robot's design, the intake seems like the most logical place to place one
		- A double flywheel intake similar to the one she developed for Over Under could work, as the unique scoring object shapes have to be accounted for.
- **Rubber Band Roller**
	- Something that could trap the q-bits (scoring objects) could be a good option, only **concern would be removing it from the bands without damage and snags**
- **Brush Intake**
	- "Hear me out; **Roomba.**" - *Sutton, 2025*
	- A brush-style intake could "sweep" the q-bits up, and then a secondary mechanism could flip/carry them to their intended scoring location
