#### Scoring Mechanism
- A belt system similar to the one we used throughout High Stakes could work
- Horizontal Conveyor
	- Small internal conveyor could safely transport q-bits **from the intake to a central scoring mechanism** or a flywheel launcher
- Pretty unsure at the moment, we will wait to discuss this further until we have our field shipped and set up.
