#RBnotes 
As of writing this, the first RI12H (robot in 12 hours) of the PushBack season has been posted (https://youtu.be/06ImrRJfcYk?si=o-iUcjIwPym5XtwP) by 9MotorGang, who utilized lots of the same concepts Stepan and Sutton had considered in our initial plans, which can be viewed at [[May 8, 2025 - Initial Thoughts]]. 

Things to note from the RI12H video include the intake design, which uses a series of rubber bands and sprockets to trap the scoring elements (which Stepan and I will call qubits, gushers, balls, cubes, and gems) within a "net", and brings them up to a secondary roller output. Stepan did the initial CAD work for the intake, which closely mimics a design that was used in a custom intra-class game our coach & robotics teacher Mr. Lichten put together. The design is essentially a set of grip wheels that "pinch" together to grab an object, and Stepan wrote about it in the Intake1 document

I would like to explore further options that include a flipper mechanism, flywheel intakes, or even a plunger style intake. I like 9MotorGang's rubber band "trap" system, but  I would be wary of the declining quality and elasticity of the rubber bands as they age, dry out, and slowly tear. Due to prior success I am partial to Stepan's "rolling pincers" idea.
