#RBresearch 
#### 5/19/25
Compared the games Stepan and Sutton have played in the past, PushBack have a very minimal focus on height and elevation. Because of this, we are able to "spend" motors more generously and avoid taking risks with a passive intake. Sutton spoke teams in Southern New York through a designated discord server, as well as 9MotorGang following the release of their RI12H video (notes are here, in [[May 19, 2025 - RI12H]]).

These groups had many different ideas, some involving a **horizontal roller intake, a claw system, and double spaced roller** intakes like the ones we common saw during the 2023-2024 OverUnder season. At the moment, Stepan has been able to create a CAD beta for an intake system that mirrors one he used in a custom post-season game developed by our robotics teacher and coach, Mr. Lichten. The image is below, and the design explanation by Stepan can be found in Intake1.
